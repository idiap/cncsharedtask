    # Let's say that one wants to ask a question how much it is still profitable to increase length of investigated
    # spans if I already investigated all spans of certain len L and I have the best f1 for tham already?
    # Because the f1 score can be expressed by:
    #   f1=2*S/(PT+GT)
    #       (S - shared tokens, PT - number of predicted span tokens, GT - number of ground truth span tokens)
    # We can be optimistic and state that if we will increase the size of predicted span we will increase the
    # number of shared tokens. The maximum number of shared tokens is S=GT. So from the expression for f1
    # and the fact that max S is GT we can get this parametrized (by x) upperbound:
    #   2*GT/(x*GT+GT) .
    # Where we expressed the PT as PT=x*GT. This function has a maximum when x=1 (f1=1) and also we must state that
    # x>=1 (for the length increase, this is what we do, x>1), because we can not have PT < GT and at the same time
    # get S=GT.
    # Ok, so now we need to get the value of parameter x somehow. We will get it with following inequality that
    # symbolically represents the profit condition:
    #   2*SK/(L+GT) < 2*GT/(x*GT+GT)
    # Where the SK is the already known number of shared tokens for spans of length L.
    # Next we can express the x from this inequality:
    #   2*SK/(L+GT) < 2*GT/(x*GT+GT)
    #   SK/(L+GT) < GT/((x+1)GT)
    #   SK/(L+GT) < 1/(x+1)
    #   (x+1) < (L+GT)/SK
    #   x < (L+GT)/SK - 1
    #   x < (L+GT-SK)/SK
    # So now we know that the x must be in (1, (L+GT-SK)/SK), therefore the PT length can be investigated maximally
    # to the length PT < GT*(L+GT-SK)/SK
    #
    # Also there is worth to mention that when the SK=0 we can omit the search, because we didn't find any
    # common token for any span at size L. The expression:
    #   x < (L+GT-SK)/SK ,
    # in limit says, that we can search indefinitely :).
